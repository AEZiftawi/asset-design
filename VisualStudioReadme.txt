Visual Studio, for any of your coding needs
it is hooked up to a local repository I set up ( look on the right hand side of the screen) The files you save 
there can be committed, then pushed to your remote respository which is hosted on github. 
I reccomend using gitkraken to handle all of your git stuff ( commiting, pushing, branching, etc) it is
also set up wit that github account, and set to monitor the same game-assets folder. 
The folder is located in your documents/repositories/
